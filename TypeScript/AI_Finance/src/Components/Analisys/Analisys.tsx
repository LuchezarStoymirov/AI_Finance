        sentiment on ETH/USD? or made an almost picture-perfect Fibonacci-based
        impulse pattern from last weekâ€™s low where green waves 1, 3, and 5
        topped and bottomed almost precisely where they ideally should (green
        boxes). See Figure 1 below. Red W-ii/b should now be underway as the
        price action since the June 17 high at $1760 is messy, i.e.,
        overlapping, and thus corrective. Note green W-1 comprised five (grey)
        waves as well, which also adhered well to the Fibonacci-based impulse
        pattern. This is the first time we have seen it this good and evident in
        a while.
