        sentiment on ETH/USD? or made an almost picture-perfect Fibonacci-based
        impulse pattern from last weekâ€™s low where green waves 1, 3, and 5
        topped and bottomed almost precisely where they ideally should (green
        boxes). See Figure 1 below. Red W-ii/b should now be underway as the
        price action since the June 17 high at $1760 is messy, i.e.,
        overlapping, and thus corrective. Note green W-1 comprised five (grey)
        waves as well, which also adhered well to the Fibonacci-based impulse
        pattern. This is the first time we have seen it this good and evident in
        a while.

        The absence of buyers at the $26,500 level indicates that selling
        pressure in the cryptocurrency market remains strong. Currently, it is
        crucial for Bitcoin to maintain support above $26,500. If it can
        consistently close above this level, the next target will be to break
        above $27,100. Achieving this would signify a reclaiming of the upward
        trend and a break of the short-term downtrend that has persisted since
        April. If Bitcoin manages to move above the $27,000 level, it will
        encounter intermediate resistance levels at $28,000 and $29,000. The
        short-term target remains in the range of $29,600 to $30,500. However,
        there is a risk of Bitcoin's downward trend accelerating if it falls
        below $27,000. If selling pressure intensifies within the current
        support zone, BTC may decline toward the $24,000 level. If hourly closes
        dip below $26,400, it could trigger bearish momentum. Conversely, hourly
        closes above the intermediate resistance at $26,600 could lead to a test
        of the falling trend line around the $27,100 area.
